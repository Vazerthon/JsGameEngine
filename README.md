# JsGameEngine
A simple and hopefully lightweight game engine written in JavaScript. Work in progress.

This is mostly an excuse to learn some of ES6's new features and to build my JS knowledge.
Hopefully this can mature into a lightweight engine that fills a gap in the market for users who don't require the power of tools like Phaser or Cocos2d-JS
